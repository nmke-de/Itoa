# Itoa

**Itoa** is a C procedure that takes an integer number and a base (between 2 and ~~16~~ 36) and returns a string that contains the number to the base that was given.

## But why?

I wanted to use Itoa, and it was not in the C standard library.

## Build

Type `make`. Make changes to the Makefile if necessary.
